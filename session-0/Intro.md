npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

## CLI - Command Line Interface

"CLI means interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text"

CLI is very popular way to do the tasks. You can create the CLI of most of the tasks. You run the CLI from the terminal , you can publish your CLI as an NPM package too. They register or save in the bin folder of node_module.

## Best Practice of CLI

- Error should be clear.
- Should be interactive.
- Should have shortcuts.

## What we will be building?

We will be building a CLI 'My Profile'. There will options(commands
) and use can select any option and CLI will give the response based on the option.
