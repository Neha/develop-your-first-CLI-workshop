## nodejs

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

### Features of nodejs

## NPM - Node Package Manager

## CLI - Command Line Interface

"CLI means interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text"

CLI is very popular way to do the tasks. You can create the CLI of most of the tasks. You run the CLI from the terminal , you can publish your CLI as an NPM package too. They register or save in the bin folder of node_module.

## Best Practice of CLI

- Error should be clear.
- Should be interactive.
- Should have shortcuts.

## What we will be building?

We will be building a CLI 'My Profile'. CLI will give options to the user to select from and based on the selection the CLI will give the response. The response will be from the JSON file saved in the CLI's code.
